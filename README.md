# ManageGlobalProtect
Turn on and off the Global Protect service.

I wrote this silly console app to enable and disable the PanGPS service.  I have to use this VPN service for a client but don't want it running all the time.

This toggles the service.  If it is off it turns it on, if it is on it turns it off.

Has to be run in administrator mode.  Doesn't always log to the console what the service status is.  Probable need some kind of 3 second delay or something.
